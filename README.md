## Personal Project: Computational Intelligence

Hello markers and wanderers, and welcome to my Personal Project around Computational Intelligence. The project report can be found under the */report* directory **(yet to be completed)**.

The entire source code is within the *main.cpp* file. Its only dependencies are the STL library and SQLite. 

### **Program Structure**

The program can be structured as follows:
```
main.cpp
│
├─── population class
│   │
│   ├─── current population object
│   ├─── population initialiser
│   └─── population mutation
│
├─── heuristic class
│   │
│   ├─── grid object
│   ├─── stepper
│   └─── grid initialiser
│
└─── main
```
